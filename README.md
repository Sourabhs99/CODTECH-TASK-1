## OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT

**Project**:**SIMPLE CALCULATOR**
It looks like you have a basic calculator program in Python. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the objective, key activities, technologies used, and key insights:

### Objective
To create a simple command-line calculator that can perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) and handle user input.

### Key Activities
1. **Define Functions**:
   - **add**: Adds two numbers.
   - **subtract**: Subtracts the second number from the first.
   - **multiply**: Multiplies two numbers.
   - **divide**: Divides the first number by the second, with error handling for division by zero.

2. **User Input Handling**:
   - **Prompt for numeric input**: Ensures that the user inputs valid numeric values.
   - **Validate operation choice**: Ensures that the user selects a valid operation.

3. **Perform Calculations**:
   - Based on user input, perform the selected arithmetic operation and display the result.

4. **Error Handling**:
   - Handles invalid numeric input and division by zero.

### Technologies Used
- **Python**: Programming language used for implementing the calculator.
- **Basic Input/Output Operations**: For interacting with the user and displaying results.

### Key Insights
- **User Input Validation**: Essential to ensure that inputs are numeric and valid choices are made for operations.
- **Error Handling**: Important to manage potential errors like division by zero and invalid inputs gracefully.
- **Looping**: Useful for repeatedly prompting the user until valid input is received.

This program serves as a practical example of basic Python programming concepts, including functions, loops, conditionals, and error handling.
